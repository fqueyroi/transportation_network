*************************
Description of the files:

- experiment_randomgrid.py : Tylip Python script (http://tulip.labri.fr/Documentation/3_6/pythonDoc/) used to generate random grids with uniform or gravity-modelled transfers between random points. Files 20171117_res8unif_alpha.csv and 20171128_res8zipf_alpha.csv  are outputs of this script.  
This requires the installation of the three Tulip plugins in the "TransportationNetworks" directory : FlowBetweenness, SPRouting and PhysariumSolver.

- plot_exp_alpha.R : R script (https://www.r-project.org/) used to produce Figures 2-3 of the paper using data from files 20171117_res8unif_alpha.csv and 20171128_res8zipf_alpha.csv

- stats_experiments.py :  Tylip Python script used in experiment_randomgrid.py to compute the performance, cost and fault tolerance of the networks.

- distance.py :  Tylip Python script used to compute minimum distances in the networks.
